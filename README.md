coffee_decorator
================

This is a code challenge anyone can join in. The goal is to create your own solution for figuring out the cost of a cup of coffee.

***Example***

* The cost of coffee is $2.00
* To add cream to your coffee is 20% of the cost of the cofee
* To add sugar to the coffee it is $0.50

If you had a coffee with everything it would cost $2.90

If you only wanted coffee and cream it would be $2.40

**Requirements**

* solution must accept additions of up 3 different ingredients that would make up your custom coffee
* ingreditents can have a set value but at least one ingreditent should be a percentage
* solution should give total cost of the coffee for *n* number of ingreditents.
* **solution should be an implemination of a decorator pattern**
